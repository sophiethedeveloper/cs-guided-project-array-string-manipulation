# Data Structures and Algorithms I - Array and String Manipulation

This is the starter code for Computer Science - Sprint 2: Data Structures and Algorithms I - Module 1: Array and String Manipulation.

### Notes

## Array and String Patterns

1. Keeping track of the order of when things are added/removed
2. Indexing
3. Iterating
4. Sorting

## Arrays are not good for:

1. Getting rid of duplicates (only storing unique values) - use dic or set instead
2. Checking if something is an element in the array (using the "in" keyword) - Has to iterate over every element in the array to check: O(n).
   In contrast, dictionaries and sets will do the same operation in O(1) time.

## In-place and Out-of-Place operations

space complexity: how much additional memory did you use?

1. In-place: re-using memory
2. Out-of-Place: allocate additional memory to perform a task
